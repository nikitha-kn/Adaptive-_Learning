Title: Math Adaptive Learning Prototype
Objective:
The goal of this prototype is to demonstrate a simple adaptive learning system that adjusts the difficulty of math problems based on a learner’s performance. This helps children (ages 5–10) practice basic addition and subtraction at the right challenge level.

System Architecture:
The system consists of four main components:

#Puzzle Generator – Creates math problems according to difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

#Performance Tracker – Records correctness and response time for each question.

#Adaptive Engine – Uses rule-based logic to increase or decrease difficulty.

#Session Summary – Displays accuracy, average time, and recommended next difficulty.

Adaptive Logic:
The difficulty level changes according to simple rules:

#2 consecutive correct answers → increase difficulty by 1

#2 consecutive wrong answers → decrease difficulty by 1

Difficulty stays within 1–3
This keeps the learner in an “optimal challenge zone.”

Metrics Tracked:

#Accuracy percentage

#Average response time

#Difficulty transitions
